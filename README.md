# chrome-incognito-history

Chrome extension which lets you reopen closed tabs in incognito

### Why

Firefox allows you to reopen closed tabs even in incognito window.
If you accidentally closed a tab in incognito in Chrome, it would not be possible to reopen it.
This extension allows you to do exactly that.

### Hotkeys

`Alt+T` - reopen recently closed tab in incognito window

Note: If this does not work, go to **chrome://extensions/shortcuts** and change the `Open recently closed tab in incognito` hotkey.

### Todo

- [ ] publish to chrome web store
- [ ] add macos hotkey
